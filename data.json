A majority of the hustle revolves around planning the submission of insurances, rent and other receipts in a way that leads to the lowest possible tax liability.\nIncome tax planning need not be a cumbersome task when you address each aspect of your income with care. While some of the tax-saving methods are very common, if you are in a higher tax bracket, you can resort to unconventional methods to maximise your savings. Here are the top 7 of them:\n\n\n\n\nContents \n\nContribute more to National Pension Scheme\nDeductions for children's tuition fees\nWedding Gift\nRoute your Investments through Parents\nMoney Spent on Donation / Charity\nExpenses for Telephone and Internet\nPay for Parents Health and Health Insurance\n\n\n\n\n\nContribute more to National Pension Scheme\n\nIf you are a subscriber of NPS, you may claim tax benefit under Sec 80CCD(1) with an overall ceiling of Rs. 1.5 lac under Sec 80 CCE. What you may not know is that you can claim an additional deduction of Rs.50,000 under Section 80CCD(1B) of Income Tax. So, to save taxes, increase your contribution to the national pension scheme.\n\n\n\n\nDeductions for children's tuition fees\n\nIf you are a parent, you can claim a deduction on the amount spent as tuition fees to a school, university, college, or any other institution. In a financial year, the maximum deduction on tuition fee payments that can be claimed together with the deductions for insurance, provident fund, pension, and other investment, is Rs 1.5 lakh. This deduction is available for a maximum of 2 children.\n\n\n\n\nWedding Gift\n\nA wedding is a huge occasion in India. The couple receives so many gifts from the guests. Such gifts are exempt from taxation under Section 56(2). Gifts received on your wedding day, whether in the form of a gift, cash, or cheque, are tax-free. This means you can claim tax benefits on the gifts you receive from your friends and relatives.\n\n\n\n\nRoute your Investments through Parents\n\nSenior citizens are entitled to special tax benefits. You can re-route your revenue from investments if your parents have a low income. So if you earn Rs.1 lakh in interest, instead of including it in your taxable income for the year, you can transfer the money to them tax-free. You can gift this money to your parents tax-free.

According to a lot of tax experts, the 2022 budget is financially sound. The biggest highlight is definitely the digital currency tax has been proposed with several other changes.\nIn this blog, let's have a look at the main findings:\n\n\nNew updated return\nBudget 2022 introduces a new 139 unit (8A) to update tax returns. If taxpayers discover errors in their returns after the deadline has passed, for example, some income has been overlooked, they will have the option to correct the IT return. They can update the return within 2 years after the end of the relevant assessment year.\nThe updated return option does not apply in the following cases:\n\nThe updated return is a loss return\nIn case, there is a reduction in tax liability or an increase in the amount of the refund\nIf searches or investigations have been carried out for the year in question\nOr if, any proceeding for assessment or reassessment is pending or completed\n\nNote:-\nTaxpayers are required to pay additional income tax at the time of submitting the updated ITR. As an additional tax deduction, it is proposed to collect an amount of twenty-five per cent or fifty per cent. In addition, interest must be paid by the additional income provided.\n\n\nDeduction for NPS u/s 80CCD:\nFor central government employees, the deduction for NPS contributions is currently authorised at 14% of pay (Basic + DA). However, it is regulated at 10% of the compensation (base salary + DA) for state government employees. It is envisaged in Budget 2022 to achieve parity between the centre and state government employees. As a result, the employer contribution deduction ceiling for state government employees will be doubled to 14 per cent.\n\n\nTaxation of virtual digital assets- Cryptocurrency\nFor the taxation of virtual digital assets, a new section 115BBH has been added. It is proposed that any income derived from the transfer of virtual digital assets be taxed at a fixed rate of 30%, with no deductions allowed for expenses spent (except the cost of acquisition).\n\n\nSurcharge on long term capital assets\nSurcharges on listed equity shares, units, and other long-term capital assets are capped at 15%, while surcharges on other long-term capital assets are capped at 37%. To bring parity in all long-term capital assets, the budget for 2022 proposes lowering the rate of surcharge for other long-term capital assets to 15%.\n\n\nIncome tax exemption on Covid treatment expenditure\nThe amount received by a taxpayer for medical treatment from an employer or from any person for the treatment of COVID-19 is not subject to income tax. In addition, if a family member receives ex-gratia as a result of a death caused by the Covid -19, the exemption for money received from the employer is proposed to be limitless, however, the exemption for money obtained from other peers is proposed to be restricted to Rs. 10 lakh in total.\n\n\nTax Incentives for the Disabled\nThe current law allows for a deduction of any amount deposited under the insurance plan to the parents or guardians only if the person dies with a disability. It results in a lump-sum payment or annuity becoming available to the disabled person. It is suggested in Budget 2022 to change that the deduction will still be available if a lump-sum payment or annuity is offered to disabled persons during the subscriber\u2019s lifetime after reaching the age of 60.\n\n\nExemption for Startups\nIf a few conditions are met, qualifying startups formed on or after April 1, 2016, but before April 1, 2022, may be eligible for tax advantages. Because there have been delays in establishing such units as a result of the pandemic, it is recommended to extend the term for incorporation of qualified start-ups for an additional year, until March 31, 2023."}, {"title": "Budget updates 2022- Direct Tax", "content": "Budget updates 2022- Direct Tax\nUpdated on: 10 Aug, 2023 04:16 PM  \n\nAs the finance minister presented the budget 2022, here are the updates related to direct taxation:\n\nProvision for filing ?Updated Income Tax returns? within 2 years from the end of relevant Assessment Year.

And because of the COVID-19 epidemic, people have high expectations from the budget this year. Here are a few things to look forward to in the budget 2022:\nFirst thing, First!As the recovery from the pandemic is still a pivotal concern, three issues are expected to be addressed in the budget. The first is to improve healthcare infrastructure. The second is assistance to those who are vulnerable. The third is public investment, which comes in the form of the National Investment Pipeline (NIP).\nNow, let's have a look at some of the major changes that we can witness in the coming budget:\nMajor Changes in The Budget 2022-23\n\nIn the next Union Budget 2022-23, salaried taxpayers may have more to look forward to. According to sources, the government may boost the Rs 50,000 standard deduction ceiling for salaried taxpayers and pensioners by 30-35 per cent.\nAs part of their proposal for the upcoming Union Budget, the life insurance industry has suggested that the government create a separate bucket for tax rebates under section 80 (C) and make annuities tax-free for the benefit of subscribers. We may expect a focus on rebates in life insurance and other policies.\nMedical costs incurred on medical treatment of selected diseases are permitted for tax deduction up to Rs. 40,000 under section 80DDB (Rs. 1 lakh in case of senior citizens). This year\u2019s budget is likely to include COVID-19 hospitalisation expenses under section 80DDB for all taxpayers up to Rs. 1,00,000/- to provide relief to taxpayers.\nIndividuals with taxable income of Rs. 5,00,000 have no tax burden, but those with taxable income of Rs. 5,00,200 will pay an estimated tax of Rs. 13,000 due to the additional Rs. 200 income. This gap may be filled by introducing marginal relief in this year's budget, similar to what is available in the case of surcharges.\nThere is no LTCG tax in major economies. To encourage more investment through the stock exchange, the government may consider abolishing the charge.\n\nBased on data collated from various sources, these are the five major areas where the taxpayers can expect some relief. The hopes from the budget are high and the government is expected to consider the long-standing tax anomalies in the upcoming budget.

Because this is a complicated and technical procedure, there is a great risk of making mistakes if you provide wrong or incomplete information.\nEspecially if you are filing your income tax return on the last day, the chances of making mistakes increase manifolds. To take your worries off your shoulder, we have compiled a list of 6 essential things that you need to keep in mind while filing your IT return. Have a look!\n\nPrepare for Filing ITRWhen you are ready to file your ITR, make sure you have all the information available with you. Make sure you have your PAN card, Aadhaar card, mobile phone to get OTP, and your login credentials.\nDocuments to Keep ReadyHaving all of the necessary documents on hand when filing your ITR will expedite the process and make everything go more smoothly. Although you don't need to submit each and every document on the portal, it is advisable to keep them handy in case you need them. The most important document that you need is Form 16 and Form 26 AS. The other documents that you might need include bank statements, capital gain statements, etc. Ensure that you have all of these so that you can avoid hasty data consolidation at the last moment.\nAvoid Common MistakesMistakes like not reporting income from rental properties, not validating the bank account, forgetting to claim certain deductions, etc., are very common. As you will be filing at the last moment, you may end up making these mistakes. It is wise to file it carefully to avoid hassles later.\nReport your Income Properly for Max Tax SavingsAnother important thing that taxpayers should pay attention to is to report the income properly. It is common to forget to report income from different sources and savings or spendings while filing tax returns at the last moment. Make sure you report everything correctly to ensure maximum refunds.\nOld Regime vs New RegimeIn lieu of foregoing specified exclusions and deductions, the Finance Act of 2020 proposed a new optional tax regime for taxpayers with modified tax slabs and rates. When completing a tax return, taxpayers will have the option of choosing between the existing and new tax regimes. Salaried taxpayers can also change the tax regime they declared to their employer when they filed their ITR.\nhanges in Tax FormsThis year, the eligibility conditions for ITR 1, which is commonly used by salaried taxpayers, have been updated. This year, ITR 1 cannot be filed by anyone who has had tax deducted at source (TDS) deducted for a cash withdrawal under Section 194N, or by employees who have deferred tax on ESOPs received from their company. So when you file your ITR, select the right form keeping these changes in mind.Apart from being an important contribution to nation-building, ITR filing also benefits individuals in a variety of ways, such as loan processing, loss carryover, and visa and credit card applications. While filing may appear to be a time-consuming task, having all of the necessary documentation and information on hand can make the process go more smoothly."}, {"title": "Rebate Under Section 87-A and Income Tax On Gains From Shares: Here\ufffds Everything You Need To Know", "content": "Rebate Under Section 87-A and Income Tax On Gains From Shares: Here's Everything You Need To Know\nUpdated on: 10 Aug, 2023 04:10 PM  \n\nEvery citizen of the country benefits from tax planning because it allows for savings and at the same time, boosts the country's development. The Income Tax Act of 1961 was created to allow citizens to manage their taxes and claim deductions. There are numerous rules and sections for citizens that help them plan their taxes. Section 87-A is one of the major tax amendments that has been in the spotlight since its inception. Taxpayers get tax relief when they obtain rebate available under section 87-A.\n\n\n\n\nContents \n\nSection 87-A: An Introduction\nWho is Eligible for the Rebate?\nGains from Shares or Stocks and Rebate under 87-A\nHow to Claim rebate under Section 87-A?\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 87-A: An Introduction\n\nSection 87A rebate is an income tax provision that allows taxpayers to lower their tax liability. It allows you to claim the refund if your yearly income does not exceed Rs 5,00,000. Your income tax burden is reduced to zero as a result of collecting this refund.\nInitially, the highest tax rebate under Section 87A of the Income Tax Act was 2,000. It was raised to 5,000 in the 2016 Union Budget. Further, it was again increased by 2,500 in the Union Budget of 2017, for people with a net taxable income of up to INR 5 Lakhs.\nFollowing the 2019 Union Budget, the government raised the net taxable income to 5 lakhs. The maximum 87A rebate amount has now been increased to Rs 12,500.\n\n\n\n\n\nWho is Eligible for the Rebate?\n\n\nThe rebate can only be claimed by individuals.\nThis reimbursement is not available to corporations, partnerships, or Hindu Undivided Families.\nIn a financial year, an individual\u2019s total taxable income should not exceed Rs. 5 Lakhs.\nThe person must be an Indian and must reside in India.\nA person\u2019s age should not exceed 80.\n\n\n\n\n\nGains from Shares or Stocks and Rebate under 87-A\n\nThere is a misconception that the rebate can be claimed on the income earned from any source after claiming all the exemptions and deduction does not exceed 5 lakhs. However, the truth is that the rebate under Section 87A can be claimed against any tax liability except for long term capital gains.\nIf the capital gains on equity are more than 1 Lakh rupees, then the tax must be paid on the gains earned for the remaining amount above 1 lakh.\nTo put this in simpler terms, if your total income is below 5 lakh after all the deductions but you have earned 1.5 Lakh as long term capital gain then you will be liable to pay tax on 50,000 rupees, on which credit under 87A will not be available.\nOn the other hand, if you earn below 1 lakh as long term capital gain and your total income after deductions and exemptions is below 5 lakh then your tax liability will become zero.\nIf the gains are short term capital gains, then the rebate can be earned to the maximum permissible limit of 12,500 rs.\nMore: You may read the details about section 87-A here.\n\n\n\n\nHow to Claim rebate under Section 87-A?\n\nThe rebate under the said section can be obtained while filing income tax returns.\nDisclaimer: This blog is only for educational purposes and should not be construed as professional advice.

Find Out Here!", "content": "Why ITR Filing Date May Get Extended Beyond 31 December 2021? Find Out Here!\nUpdated on: 10 Aug, 2023 04:09 PM  \n\nAs we all know by now that the last date for filing ITR for the fiscal year 2020-21 is December 31, 2021. This deadline has already been extended twice, first from July 31 to September 30 2021, and again to December 31 2021. In such a scenario, it seems unlikely that it would get extended.\nHowever, CAs and tax specialists believe that the ITR filing date may get extended for individuals and other taxpayers. While there is no notification till now, the tax experts are confident that their request will be heard.\nIn this guide, we have compiled the top 4 reasons why it may get extended- have a look!\n\n\n\n\nContents \n\nUncertain Load Bearing Capability\nLesser Number of Income Tax Returns Filed\nProblems in Income Tax Portal\nLengthy ITD Utilities\n\n\n\n\n\nUncertain Load Bearing Capability\n\nWith a few days left, there is a possibility that the rest of the taxpayers would be unable to file their tax returns. It is basically due to the numerous bugs that have been identified on the newly released income tax portal. As of now, the ITR due date remains to be 31st December. It needs to be seen if the recently launched e-filing income tax portal can manage the volume of people reporting their ITRs at the same time in such a short period of time.\n\n\n\n\nLesser Number of Income Tax Returns Filed\n\nIn comparison to the previous year, fewer taxpayers have submitted their ITR in FY 2020-21. According to a tweet from the Income Tax Department last year, more than 5.95 crore ITRs were submitted as of January 10, 2021. It was the last date of filing for the last year. However, this year, by 15th December only 3.59 crore ITRs have been filed. At least 2.36 crore ITRs are still to be submitted, with fewer than 15 days until the deadline of December 31.\n\n\n\n\nProblems in Income Tax Portal\n\nSeveral problems in the income tax portal have been reported by taxpayers and other stakeholders. For instance, due to the failure of the TAR schema, an incorrect date is being displayed in the previously submitted TARS.\nThe portal does not permit the submission of Form for New Registration of Trusts and Societies, hence preventing the submission of Form ITR-7. DSC functionality in some cases is also causing problems. In addition, ITR- 5 and 6 were not available on the portal for long.\n\n\n\n\nLengthy ITD Utilities\n\nIt is worth noting that ITD utilities available in the public domain have quite extensive and time-consuming regulations and issues. As a result, compiling details and completing compliances takes a significant amount of time.\nIn a nutshell, the issues like the portal\u2019s sluggish performance, lengthy utilities, etc., are creating a backlog of work with CAs, industry professionals, and other stakeholders. This necessitates more time to submit ITRs smoothly. Extension of ITR filing dates will provide relief to the taxpayers for the third time.\nThat being said, it is advisable that you should not wait for the extension as the income tax department has not yet released any notification communicating the extension of the dates.

For instance, farmers in India are exempted from paying any tax on their income from agricultural land under the country\u2019s income tax regulations.\nHowever, this does not mean that no tax is levied on agricultural land. Only the agricultural income generated from agricultural lands is exempted from taxes under this law.\nThe owner of the land has to pay the taxes and thus, it is important to understand the differences and the laws related to taxations of such lands properly. The rules related to the taxation from the sales of the land are different.\nIn this blog, we discuss everything that you need to know about taxation on the sales of agricultural land have a look!\n\n\n\n\nContents \n\nClassification of Agriculture Land In India\nRural Agriculture Land\nUrban Agricultural Land\nTaxability of sale of Agricultural Land in India\nCapital Gain Tax Exemptions\n\n\n\n\n\nClassification of Agriculture Land In India\n\nIn India, there are two categories of agricultural land: rural and urban agricultural land, according to the Income Tax Act.\nBoth types of lands are considered different and any gains from the sales of these lands are taxed differently.\nLet's look at these individually!\n\n\n\n\nRural Agriculture Land\n\nIn India, it is the land that is:\n(a) Located within the jurisdiction of a municipality and has a population of less than 10,000.\n(b) Located outside the municipality\u2019s limits but:\n\nWithin a distance of I more than 2 kilometres from the municipality\u2019s local limits and has a population of more than 10,000 but not exceeding 1,00,000.\nLocated outside the municipality\u2019s jurisdiction but within a distance of more than 2 kilometres from the municipality\u2019s local limits and has a population.\n\nMore than a distance of more than 8 kilometres from the municipality\u2019s local limits and a population of more than 10,000 people.\n\n\n\n\nDistance from municipality\nPopulation\n\n\n\n\nWithin 2 kilometres\n10,000 to 1,00,000\n\n\n2 km to 6 km\n1,00,000 to 10,00,000\n\n\n6 km to 8 km\nMore than 10 lakhs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUrban Agricultural Land\n\nThe term \u201cUrban Agricultural Land\u201d refers to land that is used for agricultural purposes and is located in a specific place. It is not the same as rural land.\na.) If it is located within the authority of a municipality and has a population of up to 10,000 people.\nb.) If located outside the municipality\u2019s boundaries, then located at a distance measured in kilometres as:\n\nUp to 2 kilometres beyond the municipality\u2019s local limits and with a population of more than 10,000 but not more than 1,00,000 people.\nTill 6 kilometres beyond the municipality\u2019s local boundaries and with a population of more than 1,00,000 but not more than 10,00,000.\nUp to 8 kilometres outside the municipality\u2019s area of jurisdiction and with a population of more than 10,000 people.\n\n\n\n\n\nTaxability of sale of Agricultural Land in India\n\nLand sales can generate two types of revenue. If the land is held as a stock in trade, the money from its sale is considered business income. However, if the land is held as an investment, the income from its sale is considered as Capital Gain.\n\nTaxation on Sales of Rural Agricultural LandAs Rural Agricultural Land does not qualify as a capital asset, there are no capital gains or losses when it is sold or transferred. This means the sale of such land would result in no capital gain, regardless of the amount involved in the transaction.\nTaxation on Urban Agricultural LandThe tax on the transfer or sale of urban agricultural land would be calculated similarly to that of other capital assets.To compute (short/long term) Capital Gains, the acquisition cost of the land and any Cost of Improvement (if any) would be deducted from the sale consideration.The type of capital gain, such as long or short term, is determined by the number of years the asset has been held by the assessee. When the capital asset is held for more than two years, the capital gain is referred to as long-term capital gain.If you acquire and sell land regularly or in the duration of your business, i.e., if you hold agricultural land as stocks in trade, then in that situation, any gains from its sale are taxed under the heading Business & Profession. This also implies that no capital gains on such agricultural land will be charged.\n\n\n\n\n\nCapital Gain Tax Exemptions\n\nUnder section 54B, there is a provision to claim capital gain exemption on the sale of urban agricultural land for investment in other agricultural lands. However, there are certain conditions that the claimant needs to satisfy, which are as follows:\n\nOnly an individual or a HUF can use the exemption offered under Section 54B of the IT Act.\nThe transferred agricultural land must be a capital asset.\nFor not less than 2 years immediately preceding the date of transfer, the assessee or his parents must have utilised the non-rural land for agricultural purposes. However, if the assessee is a HUF, the land may be used by the HUF\u2019s members.\nThe amount of Capital Gains should be deposited in the Capital Gains Account Scheme if the assessee fails to purchase the land on or before the due date for filing the return. The money deposited can be withdrawn after such land is purchased.\nThe entire capital gains are exempted if the cost of new land is equal to or greater than the capital gains. Furthermore, if the cost of new land is less than the cost of capital gains, capital gains up to the cost of new agricultural land are tax-free.\n\nThese are the laws related to the sales of agricultural land in India.

It is common to see non-resident Indians (NRIs) and persons of Indian origin (PIOs) carefully planning their stay in India for the specified year so that their income does not fall under the taxation category in both countries.\nHowever, the residential status is not always under the control of an individual and due to some unavoidable circumstances, the residential status can potentially change. In such cases, a person's income from a single source may come under the taxable category of both countries.\nTo mitigate the above issue and to foster good economic relations, countries execute a double tax avoidance agreement (DTAA). In this guide, let's explore how residential status can affect\n\n\n\n\nContents \n\nResidential Status of an Individual\nBenefits Available under DTAAs\nDTAA Rates\nIncome Types under DTAA\nThe Bottom-line\n\n\n\n\n\nResidential Status of an Individual\n\nAn individual\u2019s residential status is determined mostly by his number of days spent in India during the relevant year as well as the previous 10 years. In general, there are three types of people: residents, non-residents, and residents who are not typically residents (RNOR). The scope of taxable income in India varies depending on residency.\nFor example, for an NRI doing business outside of India (even if he only qualifies as RNOR for a certain year), his income from that foreign firm may be liable to taxes in India if he operates it from India during his stay here.\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefits Available under DTAAs\n\nThe Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement is a treaty that two nations sign to provide relief to the taxpayers from having to pay taxes several times. DTAA provides for the elimination of double taxation by:\n\nGranting one country the exclusive right to tax.\nGiving both countries the right to tax but with a provision limiting the rate of taxation.\nGranting a resident the right to obtain refunds/ credits for taxes paid in the source country.\n\nNOTE: It should be noted that the DTAA only helps NRIs from paying greater taxes in both nations.\n\n\n\n\nDTAA Rates\n\nThe DTAA specifies the rate at which tax must be deducted on income received by citizens of that country. This implies that if an NRI earns revenue in India, the TDS will be calculated using the rates specified in the DTAA with that nation. There are different rates with different countries; in general, it ranges between 7.50% to 15%.\n\n\n\n\nIncome Types under DTAA\n\nNRIs don't have to pay taxes twice on:\n\nSalary received in India\nHouse property in India\nCapital gains in India\nFixed deposits in banks in India\nSavings bank in India\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bottom-line\n\nAn individual who is residing in a nation with whom India has a DTAA can claim benefits under the treaty. His/her liability to taxation will be restricted to the extent of the treaty\u2019s rules with the source country.\nIt should be noted that despite the scope of taxation under income tax law in our country is huge. NRIs and other RNOR individuals can benefit from the rules under section 90 IT Act, 1961, subject to the set procedure such as submission of the other country\u2019s Tax Residency Certificate (TRC), etc.\nIf you find yourself in a scenario where you are unable to reap the benefits of DTAA, Tax2Win\u2019s team of expert eCAs can assist you with your income tax filing so that you may maximise your returns and keep your worries related to taxation aside.

Before investing in international stocks from India, here\u2019s everything you need to know.\nIn general, gains derived from the sale of foreign stocks would be taxed as capital gains in the hands of the Indian investor. For tax purposes, foreign stocks are treated the same as unlisted equity shares in India.\n\n\n\n\nContents \n\nGains from Foreign Stock Shares\nHow To Report Gains From Foreign Shares In ITR\n\n\n\n\n\nGains from Foreign Stock Shares \u2013\n\n\n\nTax on Gains from Sale of Foreign Shares:The tax on gains from the sale of foreign stocks is determined by the holding period of such shares. If the investor has held shares for more than 24 months then long-term capital gain (LTCG) will apply. If not, short-term capital gain (STCG) will be applicable.\n\nThe Long-term capital gains from the sale of foreign stocks are subject to a 20% tax rate, plus a surcharge, a health and education cess along with indexation benefit on the cost.\nShort-term capital gains from the sale of such stocks will be considered as a part of current income and will be taxed as per the slab rate applicable to the investor.\n\n\n\nTax on Global Mutual FundsIf a person invests in global funds that have exposure to foreign stocks, the gains on redemption of such foreign stocks are proportional to the extent of the funds\u2019 exposure to foreign stocks.\nIf the percentage of Indian equity stock is greater than 65 per cent, the gains will be taxed similarly to equity-oriented funds. Short-term capital gains on funds held for less than a year will be taxed at 15%. On these gains, the applicable cess will be levied. On the contrary, if the holding period is more than 12 months (1 year) then it will be taxed at 10% on gains above Rs.1 lakh per year.Global funds with less than 65% exposure to Indian equity will be classified as non-equity funds and taxed accordingly. Holding these for less than three years will result in short-term gains that will be taxed at the normal slab rate. On the other hand, holding the mutual funds for more than three years will be considered long-term capital gain and taxed at 20% with the indexation benefit.\n\n\nTax on Dividends Earned from Foreign SharesIf the investor has received a dividend on such holdings, then it shall be taxed at a flat rate of 25%.The Indian government has signed the Double Tax Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) with over 95 counties, which aids in the claim of tax credits in the event of double taxation. DTAA typically provides relief through two methods: (i) exemption and (ii) tax credit. The exemption method taxes income in one country while exempting it in another.If the investor has paid taxes in the foreign country for these shares, they can obtain relief on tax credits as per DTAA between India and the concerned country. In case if DTAA is not signed, the investor may obtain a unilateral relief under Section 91 of the IT Act.\nPlease note that it is essential to furnish Form No 67 as per IT rules on the date of or before filing the tax return.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow To Report Gains From Foreign Shares In ITR\n\nThe taxpayers should file ITR Form 2 to report such gains under two heads:\n\nAll gains from the sale of stocks must be reported in the capital gains schedule (Schedule CG)\nAll gains from dividends shall be reported in Schedule OS\nAll assets should be reported in the foreign asset schedule (Schedule FA) if the investor has held the shares on or after 31st March of that particular year.\n\nIf you invest in foreign stocks, keep in mind that you will have to pay taxes, as your actual returns will be the return from the stock minus taxes. Furthermore, if you invest in foreign companies, you will have to deal with currency fluctuations because the funds will be converted to dollars before being invested.\nIn addition, if the foreign assets are not disclosed, it may trigger a penalty of 10 Lakhs. Additionally, the income tax department of India would treat the tax return as a defective return under Section 139(9) and may issue notice to the assessee.\nIf you find yourself in a situation where you are required to file a tax return for gains from foreign stocks, take help from the industry's experts.

An intimation notice under section 143 (1) with the amount of the refund and a refund sequence number is sent to the taxpayer via SMS and an email. However, taxpayers must file an income tax return (ITR) to receive a refund of the excess tax paid.\nNow, if you have not received the refund, the first thing that you should do is raise a refund request. Nevertheless, there can be multiple other reasons for not receiving the refund that we will explore in this blog.\nGeneral Timeline For Receiving Tax Refund\nYou should receive your refund in your pre-validated bank account within 30-45 days after your income tax return (ITR) has been submitted.\nIf you check the income tax refund status of 2020-21, many taxpayers have not received refunds yet despite filing income tax returns (ITRs) 4-5 months ago.

There are a variety of reasons why your refund may be delayed. Let's have a look at some of the major ones:\n\n\n1. Incomplete Bank Account Information:\nThere\u2019s a possibility that while filing tax returns, taxpayers didn\u2019t provide the correct bank account number or other banking information. This may lead to discrepancies, which ultimately results in delays. Therefore, taxpayers should double-check their bank account information before completing an ITR.\n\n\nTDS/TCS Mismatch:\nOften, the amount of TDS claimed and TDS deducted does not match. The mismatch in TDS claimed in 26AS may be due to incorrect TDS return filing by the employer or TDS deductor (e.g., bank). An ITR cannot be completed because of a proposed adjustment under section 143(1)(a) or because it is defective under section 139(9). To ensure that your refund request is met, you will need to file a revised return. The taxpayers should check them and if required, contact the deductor to fix their TDS return.\n\n\nRefund Request Under Process\nIt\u2019s also possible that the delay is at the level of the IT department. It could take some time for the request to be processed, or there could be a delay on the bank\u2019s end. If you have already sent the ITR- V to the bank, send a new acknowledgement to CPC, Bangalore.\n\n\nReview Your ITR:\nIf there is a discrepancy between the information on your tax return and the information on file with the IT Department, your refund may be delayed. So, go over your ITR to see if you made any mistakes. If you select the incorrect ITR form, misspell essential personal information, or enter incorrect information, your refund will be delayed. Income tax refunds are now solely granted electronically, according to the tax department\u2019s new regime, which implies that refunds are credited directly to the taxpayer\u2019s bank accounts. If the bank account number entered on the tax form is wrong, a refund will be delayed until the error is addressed.\n\n\nAdditional Documents:\nThe Income Tax Department may require additional documentation to process your refund request in specific situations. If the department requires more proof to complete your refund request, please contact the assessing officer as soon as possible by phone or mail and submit the needed documents to ensure that your refund request is processed quickly and the cash is credited as soon as possible.\n\n\nPrevalidate Bank Account\nThe bank account must be prevalidated in order to receive an income tax refund. You can access profile settings by going to the income tax department\u2019s website and logging in with your PAN and password. You can easily find a prevalidation option for your bank account.\n\n\nRe-Evaluate\nIf there is an overdue tax amount, refund requests may be denied, and you may receive a letter from the department detailing the outstanding tax amount. If you find yourself in this scenario, go over all of your documentation and recalculate your tax liability and refund.\n\n\nE-Verification\nE-verification of ITR is mandatory within 120 days of filing ITR to complete the process. If ITR is not verified, then your ITR will become invalid & a refund will not be processed so don't forget to Verify your ITR after filing.\n\n\nAdjustment of Outstanding Demands of Previous YearsIf there is any outstanding demand from previous years then your refund may adjust with such outstanding demand. In such a scenario, check the reason for the outstanding demand and take necessary action so that your refund can be processed.Hope you find this information helpful if you have not received an income tax refund.

Did you know there are tax implications that you should take into consideration?\nCheck out what\u2019s the right way listing gains are taxed with the example of Nykaa.\nSuppose you applied for 20 shares of Nykaa at Rs 1125 each and the same got listed at Rs 2018. If you sold the shares on listing after allotment, your gain is Rs 17860. This is considered capital gain as per Income Tax Law.\n\n\n\n\nContents \n\nShort-term or Long Term Capital Gain?\nSetting Off Of Short-Term Capital Gain Against Capital Loss\n\n\n\n\n\nShort-term or Long Term Capital Gain?\n\nGains made on stocks (equities) are categorised as long term or short term capital gains which form the basis for their taxation.\n\n\n\n\nHolding period\nType of gain\nRate of Tax\n\n\n12 months or less\nShort term gain\n15% + Cess (If STT is paid)\n\n\n12 months or more\nLong term gain\nExempted up to Rs 1 lakh per year\n(inclusive of all equity-oriented mutual funds)\n10% without indexation for over Rs 1 lakh\n\n\n\n\nIn our case, as the shares were sold on the listing, your gain of Rs 17860 is considered short-term capital gain and taxed at 15%(cess+ surcharge(if any)\nSo you will be liable to pay 15% * 17860 = Rs 2679 as short-term capital gains tax [excluding Cess and Surcharge]. Please note that the benefit of the basic exemption limit will be applicable in case the taxpayer does not have any other income.\n\n\n\n\nSetting Off Of Short-Term Capital Gain Against Capital Loss\n\nIf you have any short-term capital loss, you can set it off against short-term/long-term capital gain. But the same cannot be done for long-term capital loss. That will have to be set off only against long-term capital gain.\nIf you are unable to set off the loss this year, you may carry it forward for a period of 8years provided your Income-tax return is filed this year.\nIf all these taxes and the term periods end up confusing you, leave all your worries behind by opting for assisted tax filing service with Tax2win.\n|    | 0                 | 1               | 2                                                                                                                           |\n|---:|:------------------|:----------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|  0 | Holding period    | Type of gain    | Rate of Tax                                                                                                                 |\n|  1 | 12 months or less | Short term gain | 15% + Cess (If STT is paid)                                                                                                 |\n|  2 | 12 months or more | Long term gain  | Exempted up to Rs 1 lakh per year (inclusive of all equity-oriented mutual funds) 10% without indexation for over Rs 1 lakh |"}, {"title": "Learn how medical bills of senior citizen parents can save your taxes", "content": "Learn how medical bills of senior citizen parents can save your taxes\nUpdated on: 10 Aug, 2023 04:01 PM  \n\nLearn how medical bills of senior citizen parents can save your taxes\nMaintaining good health is undoubtedly the theme of the season. With the second wave of COVID going on in full swing, health insurance looks like an unavoidable necessity that also allows you tax benefits under Sec 80D.\nBut the catch here is \u2013 health insurance premiums for senior citizens are either too high or unavailable, especially for those with pre-existing conditions. Don\u2019t worry \u2013 did you know even the medical bills of your senior citizen parents can save your taxes?\nLet\u2019s get to know how this works\n\nMedical expenditure incurred for senior citizens aged 60 or above is eligible.\nThis deduction may be claimed by self (senior citizens themselves) or for the family which includes parents, spouse, or dependent children.\nThe person for whom the deduction is claimed is not covered under any health insurance.\nExpenditure on all medical expenses, right from consultation fees to medicines, or purchase of devices like hearing aids, etc is allowed. A proof will be required.\nMost importantly- any payment made by cash is not allowed.\nThe limit on medical expenses remains the same as the one allowed for health insurance which is Rs 50000 per year for parents and Rs. 50000 per annum separately for self, spouse, or dependant children ( if senior citizen).\n\nThis year, as there are lots of instances of individuals incurring expenses on Covid related treatments, make sure you put this benefit into good use to save your taxes."}, {"title": "Major changes in Income Tax rules for the FY 2021-22", "content": "Major changes in Income Tax rules for the FY 2021-22\nUpdated on: 10 Aug, 2023 04:00 PM  \n\n\n\n\n\nContents \n\nMajor changes in Income Tax rules for the FY 2021-22\nChoosing your tax regime\nLesser time to file revised tax returns or file belated returns\nDividend income gets featured on the ITR\nEnjoy pre-filled ITR forms\nInterest on voluntary contribution to EPF beyond a limit gets taxed\nTax on ULIPs\nSenior Citizens aged 75 are not required to file ITR in certain cases\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor changes in Income Tax rules for the FY 2021-22\n\nThe government generally makes changes to the tax rules during the budget presented in February. These changes come into effect from the following financial year which starts from April.\nTake note of the changes and plan your taxes better.\n\n\n\n\nChoosing your tax regime\n\nLast year\u2019s budget gave taxpayers an option of choosing between two tax regimes. This is the second year when you will have to make a choice. What\u2019s the difference between the two? The old regime comes with a host of exemptions but with higher tax rate slabs, the new regime allows lower tax rate slabs but does not allow specified deductions & exemptions. Choose the right slab and get maximum benefits.\n\n\n\n\nLesser time to file revised tax returns or file belated returns\n\nThe tax returns are due by 31 July every year. You had a chance to file it till 31 Mar of the Assessment year with a small late fee or even revise your return. With this financial year, the window for revising returns or filing belated returns has got shorter by 3 months. You just have time till 31st Dec.\n\n\n\n\nDividend income gets featured on the ITR\n\nTill FY 2019-20, dividend distribution tax was levied on companies and dividend income from domestic companies was exempt up to Rs. 10 lakh, but from FY 2020-21, the dividend is fully taxable as per the slab rate and no dividend distribution tax to be paid by the companies. So check for TDS against dividend income in your Form 26AS and reconcile it with credit of dividend amount in your account and pay up tax according to your slab.\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy pre-filled ITR forms\n\nTo make the process of tax filing easier and more transparent, your ITR forms will come pre-filled with details of capital gains from listed securities, mutual funds, income from dividend, interest from banks and post office, salary income, etc.\n\n\n\n\nInterest on voluntary contribution to EPF beyond a limit gets taxed\n\nInterest earned on provident funds was fully exempt from income tax till F.Y.2020-21. During Budget 2021, the FM announced that the interest income on the voluntary contribution into EPF over Rs 2.5 lakh would be taxed. But later, this limit was increased to Rs 5lakhs, if your employer doesn\u2019t contribute to EPF.\nThus, if your deposit in EPF/VPF exceeds the limit prescribed, interest income will be taxable now. This comes into effect in April this year. So plan your contributions and taxes accordingly.\n\n\n\n\nTax on ULIPs\n\nThe maturity proceeds of a ULIP policy were exempt from tax if the premium did not exceed 10% of the sum assured. But the last budget changed it all! This provision will apply only when the premium of all ULIPs that you have taken doesn\u2019t exceed Rs 2.5 lakhs in a year. This rule applies for ULIPs bought after 01 Feb 2021.\n\n\n\n\nSenior Citizens aged 75 are not required to file ITR in certain cases\n\nIf senior citizens have only income from pension and interest income from a bank, they are exempted from filing IT returns subject to fulfillment of certain conditions"}, {"title": "Income Tax Return & GST filing Due Date Extended: COVID-19 Effect", "content": "Income Tax Return & GST filing Due Date Extended: COVID-19 Effect\nUpdated on: 10 Aug, 2023 03:59 PM  \n\nAmidst the complete shutdown in almost the entire country as a precautionary measure against the highly contagious covid -19 virus, the honorable Finance Minister of India Mrs. Nirmala Sitharaman had announced a series of measures on 24th March 2020 to combat the economic turbulence in India.

If the total value of the gifts exceed the figure of Rs. 50,000 in the given financial year then tax is applicable for the whole amount.\nBusiness gifts: If the gift that you have received is part of your business relations, then it is taxable in the hands of the receiver. The value of such a gift needs to be added to the taxable income and accordingly the tax needs to be paid.\n\nAs the fireworks and diyas illuminate all corners of the globe this diwali.

Before the introduction of IND AS, India's accounting system is based on Indian Generally Acceptable Accounting Principle (IGAAP).\n\n\n\n\nApplicability of IND AS\n\nOn February 16, 2015, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), notified the converged form of IFRS as the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 to maintain the uniformity and harmonization in Financial Statements and Reports.\n\n\n\n\nVoluntary Applicability\n\nA company can voluntarily choose to follow Ind AS without meeting the mandatory requirement under the law (from financial year beginning on or after April 01, 2015). However, once a company opts to follow Ind AS to report financial statements, it will have to follow Ind AS for all the subsequent Financial Statements as well.\n\n\n\n\nMandatory Applicability\n\nThe compulsory application of Ind AS has been rolled out in phases.

Accounts payable is the amount that the entity has to pay to its suppliers or vendors on the account of goods and services received. It means that after giving orders of goods and services by the entity, the firm should record a liability in its books of accounts on the basis of the invoice amount before making the payment. So this liability of the entity over its supplier or vendor is known as accounts payable. After the payment has been made to the vendor or the supplier, the amount is deducted from the accounts payable balance.\n\n\n\n\nContents \n\nImportant of Accounts Payable management\nObjective of Accounts Payable Management\nWhat is a Purchase order?\nComponents of a Purchase Order\nWhat is Receiving report?\nWhat is Vendor Invoice?\nThree-way match concept\nThe Process of Accounts Payable Management\nAutomated Accounting Management Process\nFAQ\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant of Accounts Payable management\n\nAccounts payable management is an essential tool for the proper functioning of the business entity. Let us take note of some common supporting reasons\n\nIt undertakes the responsibility of paying the entity\u2019s bills on time. As this will help in maintaining the so-called strong credit and long-term relationship with the vendors.\nIf the payment is made to the vendor on time, the vendor will provide the continuous flow of goods and services for the proper functioning of the entity and also probable trade discounts.\nAccounts Payable management has the responsibility that the payment must be done on time to avoid overdue charges, penalty or late fees.\nIt has to make sure that all the invoices can be easily tracked and paid before the due date. The same helps in avoiding the non-payment or payment for the same bill multiple times.\nThe porcess helps in maintaining the proper cash flows such as making payments only when due, by making effective and appropriate use of vendor\u2019s credit facility etc.\nIt also helps in refraining from any kind of fraud and theft in the business entity.\n\nIt is important for an entity to make sure that all its financial statements must be completed with high accuracy and the unpaid balances must be recorded with high accuracy and efficiency. In case if expense entry is done twice or unpaid transactions are not recorded, it will lead to the incorrect financial statements recorded in the book.

In this article, we will discuss such recording.\n\n\n\n\nContents \n\nMeaning\nClassification of the Balance of Payments (BoP)\nBoP on Current Account refers to the inclusion of three balances of:\nBoP on Capital Account\nBoP on Financial Account\nImportance of BoP\n\n\n\n\n\nMeaning\n\nThe balance of payments or BOP is a statement or summary of all transactions that take place between entities of one country with the rest of the world over a specified period.\nThe transactions specified above consists of import, export of goods or services or both, capital, transfer payments, i.e., remittances made by the resident of a country from outside of the country and foreign aid, the relief provided to a nation.\nWhen the Company imports more than the exports of Goods,Services and Capital then such a situation is termed as a Deficit of BoP.\nMoreover, the situation where the imports are less than the exports is termed as the Surplus of BoP. This implies that the government and residents are savers. They provide enough capital to meet the requirement of domestic production which is a good situation for boosting the economic condition.\n\n\n\n\nClassification of the Balance of Payments (BoP)\n\nMajorly the BoP is classified in two accounts which are as follows:\n\nThe Current Account and\nThe Capital Account.\n\nThe Capital Account can also be termed as the financial account and can be listed separately as a different account. So the third classification is:\n\nFinance Account\n\n\n\n\n\nBoP on Current Account refers to the inclusion of three balances of:\n\n\nMerchandise balance, i.e., Goods,\nServices balance and\nUnilateral Transfer balance\n\nThe current account is the summary of the trade balance that a country has along with the net of Income and payments. In other words, it reflects the net flow of goods, services, and unilateral transfers. The net value of the balances of visible, invisible trade and unilateral transfers defines the balance on the current account.\nThe Current Account deficit is a situation in which the residents of a country spend more on the imports.\nCurrent Account Trade Deficit is a situation in which the countries import are more than the companies exports. The imports of any goods or services that are produced in a foreign country, even if the domestic company is producing these goods or services overseas.\nThe transactions and their treatment in the Current Account\n\n\n\n\nCredit\nDebit\n\n\n\n\nVisible\n\nMerchandise Exports\nSell of goods\n\n\nVisible\n\nMerchandise Imports\nPurchase of Goods\n\n\n\n\nInvisible\n\nTransfer and Insurance services rendered abroad \nForeign tourist expenditure in the country\nInterest received on loans and investment abroad\n\n\nInvisible\n\nTransfer and Insurance services bought from abroad \nIndian tourist expenditure out of the country\nInterest paid on loans and investment abroad \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoP on Capital Account\n\nThe capital account reflects the transactions that generally do not affect the country\u2019s income, expenditure, production, or savings. This account considers the details of the acquisition or disposal of non-financial assets such as land, machinery, etc. and non-produced assets. Usually, the capital account is the smallest constituent of the balance of payments.\n\n\n\n\nBoP on Financial Account\n\nThe financial account consists of details such as:\n\nChanges related to the domestic ownership of foreign assets and\nForeign ownership of assets held locally.\n\nThe deficit is created in the financial account when foreign ownership increases more than domestic ownership. This implies that the country is acquiring assets such as gold, commodities, stocks, and shares at relatively less pace than selling off foreign assets.\n\n\n\n\nImportance of BoP\n\nBoP is used by the Businesses to ascertain whether a market of a country has a potential or it can be a prospective market for the business. As a country having a very large trade deficit is less likely to import goods and services in comparison to a country with a trade surplus.

In this article, we will discuss such recording.\n\n\n\n\nContents \n\nMeaning\nClassification of the Balance of Payments (BoP)\nBoP on Current Account refers to the inclusion of three balances of:\nBoP on Capital Account\nBoP on Financial Account\nImportance of BoP\n\n\n\n\n\nMeaning\n\nThe balance of payments or BOP is a statement or summary of all transactions that take place between entities of one country with the rest of the world over a specified period.\nThe transactions specified above consists of import, export of goods or services or both, capital, transfer payments, i.e., remittances made by the resident of a country from outside of the country and foreign aid, the relief provided to a nation.\nWhen the Company imports more than the exports of Goods,Services and Capital then such a situation is termed as a Deficit of BoP.\nMoreover, the situation where the imports are less than the exports is termed as the Surplus of BoP. This implies that the government and residents are savers. They provide enough capital to meet the requirement of domestic production which is a good situation for boosting the economic condition.\n\n\n\n\nClassification of the Balance of Payments (BoP)\n\nMajorly the BoP is classified in two accounts which are as follows:\n\nThe Current Account and\nThe Capital Account.\n\nThe Capital Account can also be termed as the financial account and can be listed separately as a different account. So the third classification is:\n\nFinance Account\n\n\n\n\n\nBoP on Current Account refers to the inclusion of three balances of:\n\n\nMerchandise balance, i.e., Goods,\nServices balance and\nUnilateral Transfer balance\n\nThe current account is the summary of the trade balance that a country has along with the net of Income and payments. In other words, it reflects the net flow of goods, services, and unilateral transfers. The net value of the balances of visible, invisible trade and unilateral transfers defines the balance on the current account.\nThe Current Account deficit is a situation in which the residents of a country spend more on the imports.\nCurrent Account Trade Deficit is a situation in which the countries import are more than the companies exports. The imports of any goods or services that are produced in a foreign country, even if the domestic company is producing these goods or services overseas.\nThe transactions and their treatment in the Current Account\n\n\n\n\nCredit\nDebit\n\n\n\n\nVisible\n\nMerchandise Exports\nSell of goods\n\n\nVisible\n\nMerchandise Imports\nPurchase of Goods\n\n\n\n\nInvisible\n\nTransfer and Insurance services rendered abroad \nForeign tourist expenditure in the country\nInterest received on loans and investment abroad\n\n\nInvisible\n\nTransfer and Insurance services bought from abroad \nIndian tourist expenditure out of the country\nInterest paid on loans and investment abroad \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoP on Capital Account\n\nThe capital account reflects the transactions that generally do not affect the country\u2019s income, expenditure, production, or savings. This account considers the details of the acquisition or disposal of non-financial assets such as land, machinery, etc. and non-produced assets. Usually, the capital account is the smallest constituent of the balance of payments.\n\n\n\n\nBoP on Financial Account\n\nThe financial account consists of details such as:\n\nChanges related to the domestic ownership of foreign assets and\nForeign ownership of assets held locally.\n\nThe deficit is created in the financial account when foreign ownership increases more than domestic ownership. This implies that the country is acquiring assets such as gold, commodities, stocks, and shares at relatively less pace than selling off foreign assets.\n\n\n\n\nImportance of BoP\n\nBoP is used by the Businesses to ascertain whether a market of a country has a potential or it can be a prospective market for the business. As a country having a very large trade deficit is less likely to import goods and services in comparison to a country with a trade surplus. The trade deficit with large quantum may even lead to the restriction on the imports in the form of Trade restrictions such as Tariff rates, Quotas, etc.\nMonetary policies and fiscal policies are formed keeping in mind the Balance of Payment as these policies decide the flow of foreign currency in a nation and ultimately results in checking the Balance of payments.\nExample\nTo understand the balance of payments, let's consider a small fictional example: not a country, but a family farm.\nLet's say that we know the following about how last year went financially for Mr. Hari, who owns a small farm in Rajasthan:\n\nThey made ?1,00,000 by selling Chana Dal.\nThey spent ?70,000 on operating expenses of the farm, including purchases of new machinery, and another ?40,000 for buying food, paying bills, replacing their worn-out tractor.\nTheir interest income from bank deposits is ?500 but paid ?10,000 for interest on their mortgage.\nThey took out a new farm loan of ?25,000 to help pay for farm irrigation system but did not use the complete loan amount immediately.

Prices of almost everything are touching the sky and it is making survival of a common man extremely difficult. Food is the most basic commodity for survival and the prices of the same fluctuate the most. It directly affects the economy and lifestyle of the common man. Since inflation occurs due to market forces, the government tries to stabilise the prices by introducing several tools. Amongst the tools introduced by the government, Dearness allowance is one of them.\nThe concept of dearness allowance was introduced after World War II. It was known as Dear Food Allowance during the early days of its inception. It was provided by the government to compensate for the request of wage revision by the employees. With time, it was linked to the Consumer Price Index .\nWith Dearness Allowance, it becomes easy for the government employees to relocate to a new place due to a job transfer. This allowance helps them in settling in and with household expenses which makes it easy for them to survive the inflating prices.\n\n\n\n\nContents \n\nWhat is the Dearness Allowance?\nWhat are the different types of Dearness Allowance?\nHow is dearness allowance calculated?\nHow is HRA different from DA?\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the Dearness Allowance?\n\nBeing a government employee comes with the added benefits and Dearness Allowance is one of them. The amount that the government pays to its employees under the umbrella of cost of living is called Dearness Allowance. Public sector employees and pensioners are entitled to this allowance. Like India, even Bangladesh follows the system of considering Dearness Allowance as a component of salary.\nAn employee's salary is made of several components like HRA (House rent allowance), contributions to the provident fund, Dearness Allowance, and several others. Dearness Allowance makes up for a certain fixed percentage as part of the basic salary. The major objective of Dearness Allowance is to dilute the effect of inflation on the lives of its employees. It is important to note that Dearness Allowance varies from person to person as it is directly dependant on the cost of living and location. Due to this, the Dearness Allowance extended to employees in urban, semi-urban, and rural area differs. The dearness allowance extended to central government employees and central public sector employees also differs.\nDearness Allowance is constantly revised to help people with the inflated prices and with this maintaining a healthy lifestyle. This allowance has been effective to only a certain extent since inflation rates are determined by the market and the market keeps changing.\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the different types of Dearness Allowance?\n\nDearness Allowance is divided into two categories for the sake of calculations. Let's take a look at these separate categories.\n\nIndustrial Dearness Allowance: Employees of a Public sector undertaking are entitled to this type of allowance. Industrial Dearness Allowance (IDA) is updated every quarter of the financial year and the revised rates of the IDA are determined by taking into consideration the Consumer Price Index. Revision becomes a necessity as inflation rate keeps fluctuating.\nVariable Dearness Allowance: Only central government employees are entitled to variable dearness allowance. This allowance is revised twice a year, i.e, in January and in July. This allowance is termed as variable because it is revised taking into consideration the increase/decrease in the consumer price index (CPI).VDA or the Variable Dearness Allowance constitutes various components. Look at the chart below to study the various components of VDA.\nConsumer Price Index: CPI or Consumer Price Index is the only component amongst three that changes on a monthly basis and these changes result in the increase/decrease of the variable dearness allowance.\nBase Index: this component of the VAD remains constant for a fixed period of time.\nVariable DA allowance: the government has the responsibility of setting and revising the minimum wages amount. Until the revision happens, Variable DA allowance stays the same.\nDearness Allowance and Income Tax exemptions: Dearness Allowance extended to salaried employees is 100% taxable. If the employee is provided with an unfurnished accommodation free of cost, then DA becomes the part of retirement benefit salary which is a component of salary if all the conditions set forth are fulfilled. According to the Income Tax Act 1961, declaration of dearness allowance in the income tax returns was made mandatory.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is dearness allowance calculated?\n\nThe government introduced the Dearness Allowance component in the salary structure post World War II. The method to calculate dearness allowance was changed in 2006 and since then this method has been used.\nTwo different methods are used to calculate DA for central government employees and for the central public sector employees. Let's look at methods separately.\nFor Central Government Employees:The dearness allowance is calculated by the following method:\n((Average of All-India Consumer Price Index (with the base year 2001 = 100) for the past 12 months \u2013 115.76) / 115.76) * 100\nFor Central Public Sector Employees:The following method is used to calculate the dearness allowance for Central Public sector employees:\n((Average of All-India Consumer Price Index (with the base year 2001 = 100) for the past 3 months \u2013 126.33) / 126.33) * 100\nThe merger of DA with basic salary:The percentage of Dearness allowance for the central employees has been rising since 2006. Currently, the dearness allowance makes up 50% of the basic salary. A constant rise in dearness allowance can be registered due to rising inflation over a period of time.According to rules and regulations, if the percentage of dearness allowance crosses the 50% mark, then it mandatorily needs to be merged with the basic salary. This merger is expected to boost the salary of the employees. This is because all the other components of the salary are calculated as the percentage of basic salary. It's been a while since the government received the request of merging dearness allowance with the basic salary. Union government's decision on the matter is still pending on the request.\nPay Commission and the Dearness Allowance:Re-evaluation of the salaries of the employees of the public sector falls with the pay commission. The salaries are re-evaluated by taking into consideration all the components of the salary. Even Dearness Allowance is taken into re-evaluation before releasing the pay commission report which contains a detailed analysis of the salary and its various components. Factors which contribute to the calculation of salaries for the central government employees are studied in detail. The pay commission is also responsible for reviewing the changes made to the multiplication factor used for calculating the DA.\nDearness Allowance for the Pensioners:Public sector retired employees are also benefited every time the pay commission rolls out a new salary structure. With every new salary structure released for the public sector employees, the pension for the retired employees is also revised. If the dearness allowances are increased, then parallelly, the same changes are incorporated in the pensions of the public sector retired employees. The pension of the retired public sector employees is inclusive of both regular pension and family pension and the changes are reflected in both the pensions.\n\n\n\n\nHow is HRA different from DA?\n\nDearness allowance like HRA (House-rent allowance) is a component of salary which is calculated as a certain percentage of basic salary and then added to the basic salary. All the components of the salary together make the total salary which every employee is entitled to.\nHRA is a house-rent allowance is a salary component. This allowance is granted by the employer to its employee to help him/her with expenses attached to renting accommodation for living purposes. Employees of both public sector and private sector are eligible for this allowance from the employer.\nCurrent rates and trends:The central government recently announced a bonanza for the public sector employees. Additionally to the 9% rate of dearness allowance for the government employees, the government announced a 3% hike in the dearness allowance. This additional benefit was effective with the start of this year, i.e, 1st January 2019. With this additional hike, the government is likely to come down by Rs. 9,200 crores. It is expected that more than one crore central government employees and pensioners will be benefited with this hike. More specifically, it will benefit around 62.03 lakhs pensioners and about 48.41 lakh employees of the central government. This hike was implemented according to the suggestions made by the Pay Commission in their report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ- Can private sector employees claim dearness allowance?\n\nNo, the dearness allowance is specifically for the public sector employees. Employees under the private sector are not eligible to claim this allowance.\n\n\n\n\nQ- Which rule sanctions the dearness allowance to the pensioners?\n\nAs per section 50.A. of the pension rule, dearness allowance is extended to the pensioners to help them with the increased prices.\n\n\n\n\nQ- Can pensioners staying abroad claim dearness allowance?\n\nPensioners who are re-employed outside India are not eligible to receive dearness allowance while staying abroad. Pensioners living abroad without taking up employment are eligible to receive dearness allowance on pension.\n\n\n\n\nQ- What is the purpose of extending dearness allowance?\n\nDearness allowance is extended to public sector employees can deal with market-based inflation without compromising on the quality of life. In other term, it is the cost of living adjustment. It is revised on a regular basis so as to compensate for changes in the consumer price index.\n\n\n\n\nQ- What is the Consumer Price Index?\n\nIt is an instrument which is used to measure which records the changes in the price of consumer goods and services bought by the households."}, {"title": "", "content": "\n|    | 0                          | 1   |      2 |      3

importance of bank reconciliation statement and the purpose it serves for the user of such information. So let's understand the meaning and why this tool of accounting is important.\n\n\n\n\nContents \n\nMeaning\nImportance of Bank Reconciliation Statement\nReasons that lead to the difference in the balances of both the books are as follows\nPreparing the Bank Reconciliation Statement\nPro forma for preparing the Bank Reconciliation Statement\n\n\n\n\n\nMeaning\n\nBank reconciliation statement is a statement which reflects the differences between the balance of bank as per the passbook and the same as per the cashbook. It shows the transactions\n\nfor which the amount is not reflected either in Passbook or in books of accounts.\nThe balance of bank as per the passbook and cash book.\n\n\n\n\n\nImportance of Bank Reconciliation Statement\n\n\nCheck on the Dishonest Behavior of Employees:This Statement keeps a check on the embezzlements done by the employees, so considered as a system of internal audit.\nDetection of Delays:It detects the reasons behind the delay in differences between the bank balance as per the cash book and pass book.\nUpdated Cash Book:It enables the business to update the books of accounts of a business with the actual situation and conditions of the bank balance. Moreover, updates it with the entries that were not known prior but can be ascertained with the help of pass book.\nCheck on the Entries:It enables the users of accounting information to keep a check on the entries for clerical errors and other mistakes or omission and make the Financial Information free from such error or misrepresentation.\nRectifying Incorrect Entries:After checking the entries, corrections can be made in the entries which are wrongly entered or wrongly debited or credited.\nAccuracy:Bank reconciliation statement ensures the accuracy of the balances and entries made in both the pass book and cash book.\n\n\n\n\n\nReasons that lead to the difference in the balances of both the books are as follows:\n\n\nDeposit in transit:The cheques or amount that were received from the clients but not deposited with the bank are known as deposit in transit. Such amount or cheque received from the client has already entered in the bank side of the cashbook, but it is not yet reflected in the bank passbook.\nOutstanding Cheque:The cheque for the payment of the debt has been issued to the supplier but either not yet given to the supplier or not presented by the supplier to the bank.\nAuto Debit / Credit Transactions:The bank charges the interest, penalty, Bank charges, NEFT/RTGS charges, etc. and on the other hand the bank provides interest on deposits, FD, etc. which can only be known at the time of matching it with the bank's statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing the Bank Reconciliation Statement\n\n\nTreating the effect of deposit in transit:Some deposits must be pending for clearance in the banking channel hence their effect cannot be traced in the bank reconciliation. For understanding how to treat such adjustments while preparing BRS (Bank Reconciliation Statement) first, we need to understand the impact of the transaction. I.e., if the cheque or amount must have been deposited in the bank than the balance of the bank is to be increased by such amount. So it is advised to increase the bank balance in the books of account while carrying out the bank reconciliation.\nTreating the effect of the outstanding cheque in the business:If such cheque has been presented to the bank, then the balance of the account is reduced by the amount of such cheque. So it is suggested to reduce the amount of bank balance in the books of accounts.\nTreating the effect of Auto Debit/Credit Transactions:For dealing with such transactions, the accountant has to change the balance of the bank in the books of account depending upon the nature of such transaction. Suppose if it is a debit transaction than reduce the balance in books of accounts and if the transaction is of credit than increase the bank balance.\n\n\n\n\n\nPro forma for preparing the Bank Reconciliation Statement\n\n\n\n\n\nParticulars\nAmount (Rs.)\nAmount (Rs.)\n\n\n\n\n(A) Balance as per Books of Accounts\nxxx\n\n\n\nAdd:\n\n\n\n\n+ Cheques issued but not yet presented in the bank\nxxx\n\n\n\n+ Interested credited by bank in our bank account\nxxx\n\n\n\n+ Direct transfer of funds by our clients into our bank account which is not recorded in books\nxxx\n\n\n\n+ Any other amount credited by the bank but not recorded in the books of accounts\nxxx\n\n\n\n(B): Total Additions:\nxxx\nxxx\n\n\nTotal (C = A + B)\n\nxxx\n\n\nLess:\n\n\n\n\n?

So let's understand the meaning and why this tool of accounting is important.\n\n\n\n\nContents \n\nMeaning\nImportance of Bank Reconciliation Statement\nReasons that lead to the difference in the balances of both the books are as follows\nPreparing the Bank Reconciliation Statement\nPro forma for preparing the Bank Reconciliation Statement\n\n\n\n\n\nMeaning\n\nBank reconciliation statement is a statement which reflects the differences between the balance of bank as per the passbook and the same as per the cashbook. It shows the transactions\n\nfor which the amount is not reflected either in Passbook or in books of accounts.\nThe balance of bank as per the passbook and cash book.\n\n\n\n\n\nImportance of Bank Reconciliation Statement\n\n\nCheck on the Dishonest Behavior of Employees:This Statement keeps a check on the embezzlements done by the employees, so considered as a system of internal audit.\nDetection of Delays:It detects the reasons behind the delay in differences between the bank balance as per the cash book and pass book.\nUpdated Cash Book:It enables the business to update the books of accounts of a business with the actual situation and conditions of the bank balance. Moreover, updates it with the entries that were not known prior but can be ascertained with the help of pass book.\nCheck on the Entries:It enables the users of accounting information to keep a check on the entries for clerical errors and other mistakes or omission and make the Financial Information free from such error or misrepresentation.\nRectifying Incorrect Entries:After checking the entries, corrections can be made in the entries which are wrongly entered or wrongly debited or credited.\nAccuracy:Bank reconciliation statement ensures the accuracy of the balances and entries made in both the pass book and cash book.\n\n\n\n\n\nReasons that lead to the difference in the balances of both the books are as follows:\n\n\nDeposit in transit:The cheques or amount that were received from the clients but not deposited with the bank are known as deposit in transit. Such amount or cheque received from the client has already entered in the bank side of the cashbook, but it is not yet reflected in the bank passbook.\nOutstanding Cheque:The cheque for the payment of the debt has been issued to the supplier but either not yet given to the supplier or not presented by the supplier to the bank.\nAuto Debit / Credit Transactions:The bank charges the interest, penalty, Bank charges, NEFT/RTGS charges, etc. and on the other hand the bank provides interest on deposits, FD, etc. which can only be known at the time of matching it with the bank's statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing the Bank Reconciliation Statement\n\n\nTreating the effect of deposit in transit:Some deposits must be pending for clearance in the banking channel hence their effect cannot be traced in the bank reconciliation. For understanding how to treat such adjustments while preparing BRS (Bank Reconciliation Statement) first, we need to understand the impact of the transaction. I.e., if the cheque or amount must have been deposited in the bank than the balance of the bank is to be increased by such amount. So it is advised to increase the bank balance in the books of account while carrying out the bank reconciliation.\nTreating the effect of the outstanding cheque in the business:If such cheque has been presented to the bank, then the balance of the account is reduced by the amount of such cheque. So it is suggested to reduce the amount of bank balance in the books of accounts.\nTreating the effect of Auto Debit/Credit Transactions:For dealing with such transactions, the accountant has to change the balance of the bank in the books of account depending upon the nature of such transaction. Suppose if it is a debit transaction than reduce the balance in books of accounts and if the transaction is of credit than increase the bank balance.\n\n\n\n\n\nPro forma for preparing the Bank Reconciliation Statement\n\n\n\n\n\nParticulars\nAmount (Rs.)\nAmount (Rs.)\n\n\n\n\n(A) Balance as per Books of Accounts\nxxx\n\n\n\nAdd:\n\n\n\n\n+ Cheques issued but not yet presented in the bank\nxxx\n\n\n\n+ Interested credited by bank in our bank account\nxxx\n\n\n\n+ Direct transfer of funds by our clients into our bank account which is not recorded in books\nxxx\n\n\n\n+ Any other amount credited by the bank but not recorded in the books of accounts\nxxx\n\n\n\n(B): Total Additions:\nxxx\nxxx\n\n\nTotal (C = A + B)\n\nxxx\n\n\nLess:\n\n\n\n\n?

For example, the United Kingdom allows its residents to have access to the best investment apps uk to invest their money, and therefore being able to make a profit. But as India is still on the backfoot in this sense, it may be a long time until they see something like this themselves. People save in the mud-made \u201cgullak\u201d and then in their saving accounts and lately in fixed deposit schemes of banks. The investment in the stock market and financial market as a whole is very limited and if compared to developed economies the retail investment is also too low. This is because of the fear of losing the hard-earned money as the risk is considered to be too high. However, with mutual funds, this fear can be put aside and retail investors can invest in stocks and derivatives by using the expertise of the fund manager, be they one trained by a LeadJig seminar or through experience in the industry. In this article, you can read about the basics of mutual funds its features, benefits, types and other information which are relevant to your search.\n\n\n\n\nContents \n\nWhat is a mutual fund?\nFeatures of a mutual fund\nTypes of Mutual Funds\nAccording to Asset Class\nAccording to the Structure of funds\nAccording to the Objectives of the Investors\nWhy one should invest in mutual funds?\nThings one should consider before investing in Mutual Funds\nWho should invest in mutual funds?\nFirst-time Mutual funds investor\u2019s checklist\nHow to invest in mutual funds?\nSummary\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a mutual fund?\n\nIn simple words, a mutual fund can be described as a collection of funds or investments from many retail investors and even HNIs and institutes and then the cumulative investment is invested in shares, bonds and other financial assets of various companies. This can be compared to an insurance policy for its approach as both collect money from several investors and customers and put them together into investment.\nThe person who manages the whole fund or the team is known as the fund manager and he or the team has a great role to play in the success of the mutual fund. They try to achieve the best possible return and often the highest returns for the cumulative investment in which your contributions make a sub part.\nThe most important thing about mutual fund is that you get to invest in the stock market even if you do not have the required sum (individually) to enter the market. Another factor which is crucial here is you as an investor do not have to worry about the market every day or you do not need to track and invest when the time is right. The fund manager is the person who does it for you. This helps retail investors and people who are not aware of the market to invest and earn from the market using mutual funds.\n\n\n\n\nFeatures of a mutual fund\n\n\nPooled investment: Mutual fund is a pooled investment where thousands of people\u2019s money are invested in stocks, bonds and derivatives instruments.\nSmall investment: You need not worry about a lump sum investment or huge investment as a mutual fund investment can be started with even Rs. 500 at present in the country. This ensures that even the smallest investors get the chance to participate in the market.\nExpertise counts: Fund managers are professionally trained to invest in the market, they have required financial knowledge, the experience of the market and most importantly the eye for the right investment to reap great profits for the clients.\nSEBI Regulation: The retail investors are similar in one thing if not all and that is they want their money and investment to be protected. This is why SEBI has been regulating all the mutual funds in India and this ensures the safety of your investment.\nHigh returns: General people do not much think of investing in the stock market as the market is risky even if it generates high return than traditional financial instruments like Bank FDs or savings accounts. Mutual funds help this investor to earn a higher return from conventional investments without taking that much risk.\nGreat exposure: Retail investor due to lack of capital cannot get access to invest in portfolios which are huge and earning good return regularly. This drawback is also addressed by the mutual fund and due to the pooled investment strategy, all the investments (accumulation of small investment) can be invested into large portfolios.\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Mutual Funds\n\nThe types of mutual funds are decided according to three aspects\n\nAsset Class\nStructure of fund\nObjectives of the investor\n\nUnder these three categories, there are different types of mutual funds which are discussed below.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Asset Class\n\n\nDebt Funds: These are a safe investment as the fund is invested in financial assets like government bonds, debentures issued by the companies and other fixed-income instruments. They bear a fixed return on a periodic basis and thus are considered to be the safest mutual fund investment.\nEquity fund: These are considered to be high risk and high return funds as the underlying assets are stocks and shares of various companies.\nHybrid funds: When a fund is invested into both equity and debt asset class then they are called hybrid funds. This is to strike a balance between risk and return of two asset classes and provide a good amount of return without much risk.\nMoney market funds: If a mutual fund is invested in financial assets like T-bills, CPs and similar instrument then they are called money market fund. These are other safe options for the investors as these funds provide a moderate rate of return but you get the returns within a short span of time.\nSector-based funds: If a mutual fund is invested into stocks of a particular sector then the fund can be referred to as sector fund. For example, the mutual fund you invest into further invests the accumulated funds in stocks of real estate companies only. In this case, the fund is a sector fund and the sector is real estate.\n\nThe performance of this type of fund is based on the performance of the sector the fund is invested in.\n\nTax-saving funds: Mutual funds can also be used for saving taxes however only equity-based schemes are considered for the same. So, the risk is higher in case of this category of mutual funds.\nIndexed funds: The funds which are invested into certain indexes like Nifty, S&P 500, etc. are known as indexed funds.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Structure of funds\n\n\nOpen Ended funds: Mutual funds are known as open-ended as buying and selling in these funds takes place throughout the year. The value at which the units of these funds are purchased and redeemed is the Net asset value or NAV. The most important aspect of these funds is liquidity quotient.\nClose Ended Funds: In these type of funds the units are purchased at the initial time of opening the fund only and then they can be redeemed only after a specific period of time which is the maturity period of these funds. However, the liquidity of these funds is addressed by enlisting them on the stock exchange.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Objectives of the Investors\n\n\nLiquid funds: If the investor is investing in mutual funds with the purpose of using the fund anytime they want, in that case, the liquidity of the fund has to be higher. These funds thus invest in financial instruments like T-bills or CPs which have very short maturity.\nGrowth Funds: Mutual funds are mostly opted by retail and small investors who cannot invest in the financial market directly for various reasons and mostly the investors want is to see their investment grow. These funds are thus mainly equity-based funds with higher returns and long maturity period so that the fund can grow to the desired level.\nIncome funds: These are for investors who want regular income from mutual fund investment. Debentures, government bonds, and fixed income instruments are some of the underlying for these types of funds.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy one should invest in mutual funds?\n\n\nDiversification of investment:The first thing that comes up in mind with a mutual fund is diversification.

The maximum percentage of charges a mutual fund house can levy upon you is 2.5% (according to SEBI Regulations). This amount is deducted from the investment you make.\nDifferent lock-in-term or maturity period:If you are looking for short term investment there are liquid funds or the money market funds. If you are looking for growth there are equity-based funds. The maturity of all these funds varies from each other depending on the type of fund you invest in.\nGoal oriented:The fund manager first understands your requirement for the mutual fund invests. Then accordingly he or she puts your investment in such funds which replicate your investment objective. They also switch between funds if one is doing better than others or if your objective changes.\nLiquidity of investment:If you are worried about investments of yours being locked out, you need not worry as you can redeem them anytime you want without providing any justification to the MF house.\nTax benefit:You can also get a tax benefit for investing in mutual funds.

As of now, the interest rate is a PPF is 7.1% p.a., compounded annually. This means that the interest earned on the PPF balance is added to the principal amount at the end of each year and earns interest in the subsequent years.
